11.	Write a C program for possible keys does the Playfair cipher have? Ignore the fact that some keys 
might produce identical encryption results. Express your answer as an approximate power of 2.

a.	Now take into account the fact that some Playfair keys produce the same encryption results. 
How many effectively unique keys does the Playfair cipher have?

PROGRAM :-

import math

def calculate_possible_keys(unique_positions):
    return math.factorial(unique_positions)

def calculate_effectively_unique_keys(total_keys, identical_keys):
    return total_keys // identical_keys

def main():
    total_positions = 25  # Total unique positions in the Playfair matrix
    total_letters = 26    # Total letters in the English alphabet
    identical_keys = 2    # Two keys may produce identical results due to the symmetry of the matrix

    possible_keys = calculate_possible_keys(total_positions)
    effectively_unique_keys = calculate_effectively_unique_keys(possible_keys, identical_keys)

    print("Possible keys without considering duplicate results:", possible_keys)
    print("Effectively unique keys considering duplicate results:", effectively_unique_keys)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
